      "I wanted to inform you about a slight change in our project timeline for the new customer relationship management (CRM) system implementation. After careful consideration and discussions with key stakeholders, we've decided to extend the deadline by three weeks. Here's why:\n\n1. Integration complexities: We've encountered some unexpected challenges in integrating the new CRM with our existing systems. Our IT team needs additional time to ensure seamless data flow and avoid any disruptions to our daily operations.\n\n2. User training: Initial feedback from the pilot group suggests that we need to allocate more time for comprehensive user training. We want to ensure that all departments are comfortable with the new system before full deployment.\n\n3. Data migration: The volume of historical data to be migrated is larger than initially estimated. We're taking extra precautions to maintain data integrity during the transfer process.\n\n4. Additional customization: Some departments have requested specific customizations that will greatly enhance their workflow. We believe these adjustments are valuable and worth the extra time investment.\n\n5. Quality assurance: With these changes, we want to conduct more thorough testing to guarantee a smooth launch.\n\nThe new project completion date is set for [NEW DATE]. We're confident that this extension will result in a more robust and user-friendly CRM system. I'll be scheduling individual meetings with department heads to discuss how this change might affect their teams and to address any concerns.\n\nThank you for your understanding and continued support. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.",
